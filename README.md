# Flask-MongoDB Web App

We created an app named online discussion app. And in this app, we achieved the basic comment sections that we use in the other websites in our daily life. The user can not get access to the home page in the first place and directly be sent to the login page. We are able to determine if the user has registered, and if not (when the username does not exist), redirect the page to the registration. If the password is "wrong" in the login page, then, it will flash and say the password is wrong.  
After logging into the app, we can post the messages using the log-in username. And for the other messages, what we can do is only delete and edit the messages posted by the same log-in username. And for other messages, neither deletion or edition can be done. 
Also, we have a "search" button here to search for certain content in the whole comment section. We have also tried to add a “like” function, but we didn’t have time to finish it.
Finally, when the users want to leave the app, we can click the "log out" button to log out the app. 
Test.
